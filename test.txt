My favorite verse is Philippians 2:9-11. I love this verse because it gives much hope that my Lord will be exalted among the nations. Not just among His people, but He will be vindicated in His honor by everyone. Everyone who mocked Him and scorned Him and hated Him and blasphemed Him will be humbled and laid low.
I also like John 3:16, and Romans 3:23, and Romans 6:23. Those are all cool verses.
Romans 3:23, 6:23 are very cool. I also really love the verses Romans 3:23, 6:23, 8:1, and also John 1:1-5,9-13, 14, 3:16. They are awesome!
